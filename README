NAME
       audiomoth - command-line interface to the AudioMoth acoustic logger

SYNOPSIS
       audiomoth [--uid uid] [-i]
       audiomoth [--uid uid] -T
       audiomoth [--uid uid] [configuration options ...]
       audiomoth --help
       audiomoth --version

DESCRIPTION
       The AudioMoth is an acoustic logger for outdoors use from Open Acous-
       tic Devices. This utility lets you configure an AudioMoth and set its
       clock - like the official utilities, but without pulling in the whole
       Node.js and React.js ecosystems, and without a GUI.

       audiomoth(1) has three basic operations:

       -  Show the device's time, battery  level,  identifier  and  firmware
          version.
       -  Set  the device's clock. This is a common operation, since the Au-
          dioMoth loses time when you replace the batteries.
       -  Configure the device.

       It cannot be used to upgrade the firmware. Nor can it show  the  cur-
       rent configuration, e.g. recording schedule and gain.
